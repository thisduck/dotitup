### tpope/vim-abolish
Just read the docs for this one:
https://github.com/tpope/vim-abolish
```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-abolish'
```

### tpope/vim-surround
Adds the ability to change surrounding quotes/tags.

For example `'something'` and change to `"something"`
with the cursor over the word: `cs'"`
Which says: change surrounding single quotes to double quotes.

It works for tags as well, so for `"something"`,
`cs"<b>` will change it to `<b>something</b>`.
And then to change that to `'something'`, do `cst'`
Which says: change surrounding tag to single quotes.

You can also add surrounding characters to text objects 
that have none. So for `something`, `ysaw'`
Which says: add surrounding around word to single quotes.
That's not proper English but you get the gist.

See vim-surround readme for more.

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-surround'
```

### tpope/vim-unimpaired

using `[` for previous and `]` for next

| Instruction   | Description                                                   |
| ---           | ---                                                           |
| `[q` and `]q` | for `:cnext` and `:cprev` (navigating quickfix)               |
| `[b` and `]b` | for `:bnext` and `:bprev` (navigating buffers)                |
| `[f` and `]f` | for prev/next file in directory (navigating files)            |
| `[f` and `]f` | for prev/next file in directory (navigating files)            |
| `[n` and `]n` | for prev/next git conflict in the file (navigating conflicts) |

There are many more helpful shortcuts, see `:help unimpaired`

```vim
Plug 'tpope/vim-unimpaired'
```

### terryma/vim-multiple-cursors
Adds multiple cursor editing support
Use `<C-n>` to highlight the word under the cursor
Repeat `<C-n>` to select the next instances of the word
Then you can use normal editing comments, like `c` to change
all the selected words together.

There are ways to use with visual selections as well, see docs.

```vim
Plug 'terryma/vim-multiple-cursors'
```

### bogado/file-line
Allows the ability to enter a file exactly at it's line.
e.g. on the command line if you started vim like:
`vim part/to/file.rb:35`
it will take you to line 35 of file.rb
Can also be used with opening files normally in vim:
`:e part/to/file.rb:35`
Would also take you to like 35 of file.rb

This is great for copy pasting file + line number from 
error outputs and going directly to the source instead
of additionally finding the line after opening the file.

```vim
Plug 'bogado/file-line'
```

### vim-scripts/camelcasemotion

| `,b`        | equivalent of `b` for camel case motion |
| `,e`        | equivalent of `e` for camel case motion |

```vim
Plug 'vim-scripts/camelcasemotion'
```
